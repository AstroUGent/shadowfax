= The flat density test =

This test is used to test the cooling and heating routines. It consists of a
box filled with a uniform homogeneous gas with a single density and pressure
which is at rest. Since all cells have the same properties, they should all
cool down or heat up in the same way, and we can make use of the total energy
of the box to check if the cooling/heating is what we expect it to be.
